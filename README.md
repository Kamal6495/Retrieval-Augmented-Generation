# Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-using-LangChain
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with LangChain is a technique that enhances the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating them with external knowledge bases. This addresses limitations of LLMs, such as reliance on fixed training data and lack of access to proprietary or real-time information.
